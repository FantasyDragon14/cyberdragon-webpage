                <li>all data is stored on my own server in germany.</li>
                <li>I will delete your data on request, otherwise it will be kept until i need space (i haven't implemented a system to automatically delete data yet)</li>
                <li>i will not share this data with anyone without permission (certain data for a discord server is available for users with administrator rights in that server however)</li>
            </ul>i don't actually know how to write a privacy-policy, but i'll notice server owners if i change anything important in the privacy-policy</p>
